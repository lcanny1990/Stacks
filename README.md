# Stacks
This stack class template uses a doubly linked list as its underlying container. Written in C++, it has been templatized so that any data type can be used. 

The functions allowed by the stack are: 
  - clear()
  - is_empty()
  - push()
  - pop()
  - top()

in order to use it you will need to also download the DLL.h file under my Linked-List-C repository
